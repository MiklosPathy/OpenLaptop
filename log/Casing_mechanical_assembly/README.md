- Keep together the parts
	- Cooling
		- The cooler block is very strongly attached to the mainboard, no problem with that.
		- The fan must be mounted somehow to the plastic frame
	- Keyboard
		- The keyboard is colliding with the cooler block. Workaround needed.
		- Needs custom cabling.
- Have hinge for closing the lid
	- Currently the hinge is a 10 mm electrical PVC tube. The cabling to the lid can be easily routed and provides big braking area.
- Have more or less acceptable cabling
