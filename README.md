# OpenLaptop
Open Source Laptop hardware based on industry standards

Goals:

Build/develop and maintain your laptop, as you do with your desktop computer.

Current ideas:

- Thin Mini ITX mainboard
  - Low power processor used (<35W)
  - Laptop memories
- USB Keyboard (internal connectors)
- Touchpad : TBD
- Mouse : USB (external)
- Display : some LVDS 40 panel with case and hinge, probably ASUS (because of the selected mainboard, some eDP or HDMI display would be better)
- Case: Self made, bent/welded aluminium plate casing
- Power : Currently only external power, battery/power management TBD
-
