# What is this

Open Source PC casing in Laptop form. Based on industry standards for everyday use.

![](Current_CAD_Render.png)

# Goals

- Build/develop and maintain your laptop, as you do with your desktop computer.
- The baseline size factor somewhere around Lenovo T520/W520 (The last known useable laptop in history.)
- Daily useable computer. So: Up to date x86 architecture, Windows. 

Project ceases: If laptop manufacturers starts to build laptops again with _keyboards_, not with randomly placed buttons.

# Current ideas

- Thin Mini ITX mainboard
  - Low power processor used (<35W)
  - Laptop memories
- USB Keyboard (internal connectors)
- Touchpad : TBD
- Mouse : USB (external)
- Display : some LVDS 40 panel with case and hinge, (some eDP or HDMI display would be better, but this is just wishful thinking)
- Case: Self made, bent/welded aluminium plate casing, 3D printed plastic parts
- Battery/power management : TBD Currently only external power
- Sound : TBD Currently external sound
